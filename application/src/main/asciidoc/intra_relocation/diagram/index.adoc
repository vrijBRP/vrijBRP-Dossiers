`1. Get tasks by BSN of the main occupant`

Use this endpoint to retrieve the pending tasks of a specific person.
This can be done by:

- BSN
- Task type (relocation_consent, etc)
- Statusses (planned, in_progress, done)

By calling this API with a BSN a 'relocation consent' task will be returned if that person is the main occupant and the relocation is currently awaiting consent.

The response message will include the dossier-ID and dossier-type.
That information can then be used to lookup the complete relocation by calling the specific search endpoint described below.

```javascript

relocationConsentIsRequired:boolean = (
  bsn.includes('<bsn of main occupant>')
  && dossierType == 'intra_mun_relocation'
  && taskType == 'relocation_lodging_consent'
  && status == 'planned'
);
```

[.lead]
`2. Get relocations by dossier ID`

Use this endpoint to retrieve one complete intra-municipal relocation by a specific dossier ID.

The response message will include the relocators, live-in situation and main occupant.
These elements could be shown to the UI to the user.
The elements 'status', 'liveInApplicable' and 'consent status' will determine if additional consent is required by the main occupant.

If the relocation is not found then status 404: NOT FOUND is returned.

```javascript

# Optional check based on the relocation response

relocationConsentIsRequired:boolean = (
  status == 'incomplete'
  && newAddress.liveIn.liveInApplicable == true
  && newAddress.liveIn.consent == 'PENDING'
);
```

[.lead]
`3. Post lodging consent`

Use this endpoint to update the lodging consent situation

If the post is successful status 200:OK is return with an empty body.
